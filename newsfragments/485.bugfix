The treatment of reference instrument models with the command-line argument ``reference_geometry=`` has been improved.

Previously, one needed to pass a separate 'experiment list' (``.expt``) file for each instrument model.
If any of the files contained multiple instrument models (if they had been created from multiple-sweep rotation data, for example), xia2 was a bit fragile and could sometimes fail with an erroneous message "no sweeps found".

Now, one can pass any number of ``.expt`` files with ``reference_geometry=`` arguments and each file may contain any number of instrument models.
xia2 will sort out any duplicate models for you.
