Perform systematic absence analysis in multiplex

- Run dials.symmetry in systematic-absences-only mode after scaling to determine
  full space group in xia2.multiplex
- Set laue_group= to skip Laue group determination by dials.cosym
- Set space_group= to skip both Laue group determination by dials.cosym and
  systematic absences analysis by dials.symmetry
