Installation
++++++++++++

The recommended way of obtaining the latest xia2 is to install the latest
xia2/DIALS bundle which can be obtained
`here <https://dials.github.io/installation.html>`_.

xia2 depends critically on having CCP4 available. The ``dials`` and ``dials-aimless``
pipelines will work with only xia2 and CCP4 installed. In order to use the
``3d``, ``3di`` and ``3dii`` pipelines you will also need XDS.

The standard recommended procedure for installing xia2 is therefore:

* Install CCP4 from http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/download/. This now includes xia2/DIALS
  as part of the installation.
* Optionally download the latest xia2/DIALS bundle from https://dials.github.io/installation.html.
  Once installed, simply sourcing the dials_env.sh script in the installation
  directory will make available all xia2 and DIALS commands in the current
  terminal. Make sure to source the dials_env.sh script after the CCP4 setup
  script
* Optionally download XDS from http://xds.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de/ and add this to your path [1]_

By and large, if these instruction are followed you should end up with a
happy xia2 installation. If you find any problems itâ€™s always worth checking
the `blog`_ or sending an email to xia2.support@gmail.com.
