    abstract = {In processing X-ray diffraction data, the intensities obtained from
    integration of the diffraction images must be corrected for experimental effects
    in order to place all intensities on a common scale both within and between data
    collections. Scaling corrects for effects such as changes in sample illumination,
    absorption and, to some extent, global radiation damage that cause the measured
    intensities of symmetry-equivalent observations to differ throughout a data set.
    This necessarily requires a prior evaluation of the point-group symmetry of the
    crystal. This paper describes and evaluates the scaling algorithms implemented
    within the {\it DIALS} data-processing package and demonstrates the effectiveness
    and key features of the implementation on example macromolecular crystallographic
    rotation data. In particular, the scaling algorithms enable new workflows for
    the scaling of multi-crystal or multi-sweep data sets, providing the analysis
    required to support current trends towards collecting data from ever-smaller samples.
    In addition, the implementation of a free-set validation method is discussed,
    which allows the quantification of the suitability of scaling-model and algorithm
    choices.},

    abstract = {In macromolecular crystallography, radiation damage limits the amount
    of data that can be collected from a single crystal. It is often necessary to
    merge data sets from multiple crystals; for example, small-wedge data collections
    from micro-crystals, {\it in situ} room-temperature data collections and data
    collection from membrane proteins in lipidic mesophases. Whilst the indexing and
    integration of individual data sets may be relatively straightforward with existing
    software, merging multiple data sets from small wedges presents new challenges.
    The identification of a consensus symmetry can be problematic, particularly in
    the presence of a potential indexing ambiguity. Furthermore, the presence of non-isomorphous
    or poor-quality data sets may reduce the overall quality of the final merged data
    set. To facilitate and help to optimize the scaling and merging of multiple data
    sets, a new program, {\it xia}2.{\it multiplex}, has been developed which takes
    data sets individually integrated with {\it DIALS} and performs symmetry analysis,
    scaling and merging of multi-crystal data sets. {\it xia}2.{\it multiplex} also
    performs analysis of various pathologies that typically affect multi-crystal data
    sets, including non-isomorphism, radiation damage and preferential orientation.
    After the description of a number of use cases, the benefit of {\it xia}2.{\it
    multiplex} is demonstrated within a wider autoprocessing framework in facilitating
    a multi-crystal experiment collected as part of {\it in situ} room-temperature
    fragment-screening experiments on the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.},
