xia2 0.6.256 (DIALS 2.0.0) (2019-10-23)
=======================================

Features
--------

- Change the default pipeline (dials) to use DIALS for scaling instead of AIMLESS

  Scaling with AIMLESS is still available by running xia2 with ``pipeline=dials-aimless`` (#301)
- Reduce the number of calls to dials.export for performance improvement.

  The integrated.mtz (unscaled) no longer appears in the Logfiles but can
  be generated from the corresponding .refl and .expt files (#329)
